    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, providing high performance, scalability, and flexibility. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB doesn't store data in tables with fixed columns and rows, but instead, it stores data in collections of documents that can have varying structures and fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that don't use the traditional relational model for data storage and management. Instead of using tables, they use different models such as document-oriented, key-value, graph-based, and column-family.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases are preferred in scenarios where the data is unstructured, complex, or needs to scale horizontally. They are also a good fit for applications that require high availability, low latency, and real-time data processing. Non-relational databases are generally more flexible and can handle a large volume of data compared to SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data is unstructured or semi-structured, and there is a need for a flexible data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is a need for high scalability and performance, especially in write-intensive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The data is geographically distributed, and there is a need for multi-region replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The application requires real-time data processing and analysis, and there is a need for fast query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. There is a need for a database that can handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally as the data grows."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a variety of features that make it a preferred choice for developers and organizations. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Document-Oriented`: MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents, providing flexibility in data modeling and schema design.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Dynamic Schema`: MongoDB allows you to create collections without a predefined schema, making it easy to evolve your data model as your application changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `High Availability`: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replication, ensuring that your data is always available, even in the case of a server failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Horizontal Scalability`: MongoDB supports sharding, allowing you to distribute your data across multiple servers to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Flexible Querying`: MongoDB offers a powerful query language that allows you to perform complex queries on your data, including aggregation, indexing, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Full-Text Search`: MongoDB provides a built-in full-text search engine that enables text search across multiple fields and collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Multi-Document ACID Transactions`: MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity across multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `Built-in Aggregation Framework`: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data analysis and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `Cloud Integration`: MongoDB offers native integration with popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, making it easy to deploy and manage MongoDB in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `Community Support`: MongoDB has a large and active community of developers, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and support to help you get started with MongoDB."
