    "In a `one-tailed test`, also known as a directional test, the null hypothesis is directional and specifies a difference in one direction only. For example, if we are testing the hypothesis that a new drug will increase the mean lifespan of patients, the one-tailed null hypothesis would be that the drug does not increase the mean lifespan of patients, or that the mean lifespan of patients who receive the drug is less than or equal to the mean lifespan of patients who do not receive the drug.\n",

    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter, such as a population mean or proportion, based on a sample of data. It provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate, and gives us an indication of how much we can trust the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is calculated using the sample data and the desired level of confidence, which is typically expressed as a percentage. The level of confidence refers to the probability that the true population parameter lies within the calculated interval. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that we can be 95% confident that the true population parameter falls within the calculated range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, we need to determine the sample size, the sample mean or proportion, and the standard error of the sample statistic. The formula for calculating a confidence interval depends on the type of data and the sample size.\n",

    "Here is an example of how to calculate a confidence interval for a population mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to estimate the average height of male college students in the United States. We take a random sample of 50 male college students and measure their heights in inches. The sample mean height is 68 inches, and the standard deviation is 3 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean height.\n",

    "The margin of error in a confidence interval is the range of values that we add and subtract from the point estimate (such as the sample mean or proportion) to create an interval that is likely to contain the true population value with a certain level of confidence. The margin of error represents the degree of uncertainty in our estimate and is affected by factors such as the sample size, level of confidence, and variability of the population.\n",

    "As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, since larger sample sizes provide more precise estimates of the population parameter.
