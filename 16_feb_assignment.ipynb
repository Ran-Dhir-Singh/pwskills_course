    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a software system that stores and organizes data in a structured way, allowing it to be easily retrieved, updated, and managed. Databases are used in a variety of applications, including web and mobile applications, business systems, and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that have different structures, use different languages to interact with data, and have different strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on the Structured Query Language (SQL) and are designed to store and manage data in tables with predefined relationships between them. SQL databases are highly structured, require a fixed schema, and are best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as banking systems and e-commerce platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to store and manage unstructured data, such as documents, graphs, and key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are highly flexible and do not require a predefined schema, making them ideal for applications that require rapid development and scalability, such as social media platforms and real-time analytics systems.\n",

The primary key is used to ensure data integrity and to enforce relationships between tables. In most cases, a primary key is automatically created by the database management system when a new table is created. For example, in a table of employees, the employee ID could be used as the primary key.\n",

A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, where the values in the foreign key column(s) in one table match the values in the primary key column(s) in another table. This relationship ensures that data is consistent and helps prevent errors and inconsistencies in the database. For example, in a table of orders, the customer ID could be a foreign key that references the primary key of the customers table.\n",
