    "### Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important concepts in linear algebra that have applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues are scalar values that are associated with a square matrix. They represent the scaling factor by which an eigenvector is stretched or shrunk when it is multiplied by the matrix. Eigenvectors, on the other hand, are non-zero vectors that satisfy a certain condition when multiplied by a matrix. Specifically, when an eigenvector is multiplied by a matrix, the resulting vector is parallel to the original eigenvector, but with a different magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigen-decomposition approach is a method of decomposing a matrix into its constituent eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This can be useful in a variety of applications, including solving systems of linear equations, analyzing dynamic systems, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, let's consider the following example. Suppose we have a 2x2 matrix A:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = [2 1]\n",
    "        [1 2]\n",
    "        \n",
    "To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix, we first need to solve the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A * v = λ * v\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "where I is the identity matrix. Solving for λ requires finding the values of λ that make the determinant of A - λ * I equal to zero. We can do this as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "    det(A - λ * I) = (2 - λ) * (2 - λ) - 1 * 1\n",
    "               = λ^2 - 4λ + 3\n",
    "               = (λ - 3) * (λ - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the eigenvalues of A are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the corresponding eigenvectors, we need to solve for v using each eigenvalue in turn. Starting with λ1 = 3, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (A - λ1 * I) * v = 0\n",
    "    [2-3  1 ] [v1]   [-1v1] = 0\n",
    "    [1  2-3] [v2]   [ v2]   = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for v, we get v1 = v2. Letting v2 = 1, we get v1 = -1. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 is [ -1 1 ].\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for λ2 = 1, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (A - λ2 * I) * v = 0\n",
    "    [2-1  1 ] [v1]   [ v1] = 0\n",
    "    [1  2-1] [v2]   [-1v2] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for v, we get v1 = v2. Letting v2 = 1, we get v1 = 1. Therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to λ2 is [ 1 1 ].\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the eigen-decomposition of A is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = V * Λ * V^-1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where V is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, Λ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of A, and V^-1 is the inverse of V. Plugging in the values we found for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = [ -1  1 ] [ 3  0 ] [ 1  1 ]\n",
    "    [  1  1 ] [ 0  1 ] [-1  1 ]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the eigen-decomposition of A, which represents A as a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We can verify that this is correct by multiplying the matrices on the right-hand side together:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    V * Λ * V^-1 = [ -1  1 ] [ 3  0 ] [ 1  1 ] [ 1/2   1/2 ]\n",
    "               [  1  1 ] [ 0  1 ] [-1  1 ] [-1/2   1/2 ]\n",
    "             = [  2  1 ]\n",
    "               [  1  2 ]\n",
    "             = A\n",
    "\n",
    "So the original matrix A can be reconstructed from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as diagonalizing matrices, solving differential equations, and more."

    "### Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen decomposition, also known as spectral decomposition, is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that involves decomposing a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In other words, it is a way to express a matrix as a linear combination of its eigenvectors, which are special vectors that have important properties, and corresponding eigenvalues, which are scalars that measure the extent to which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk when the matrix is applied to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of eigen decomposition lies in the fact that it provides a powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating matrices in many different contexts. Specifically, some of the key applications of eigen decomposition include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Diagonalization: Eigen decomposition can be used to diagonalize a matrix, which means to express it as a diagonal matrix (a matrix in which all off-diagonal elements are zero) that has the same eigenvalues as the original matrix. Diagonalization is useful in many areas of mathematics and science, including linear differential equations, quantum mechanics, and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a powerful statistical technique that is used to identify patterns in high-dimensional data. It is based on eigen decomposition and involves finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvectors represent the principal axes of variation in the data, while the eigenvalues represent the amount of variation explained by each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Solving Linear Equations: Eigen decomposition can be used to solve systems of linear equations, by expressing the system as a matrix equation and then decomposing the matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This can simplify the problem and make it easier to find solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Image Compression: Eigen decomposition is also used in image compression techniques, such as JPEG and MPEG, which rely on expressing an image as a linear combination of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and then approximating the image using a smaller number of components."

    "### Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A square matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the size of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let A be an n x n matrix that is diagonalizable, meaning that it can be decomposed as A = VΛV^-1, where V is an n x n matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, and Λ is an n x n diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the corresponding eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that A has k distinct eigenvalues, each with a geometric multiplicity of m_i (i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue). Then we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_k = n\n",
    "\n",
    "since the sum of the geometric multiplicities must equal the size of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let S be the matrix formed by taking m_i linearly independent eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, so that S is an n x n matrix with m_i columns corresponding to the ith eigenvalue. Since the eigenvectors are linearly independent, S is invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "A S = S Λ + E\n",
    "\n",
    "where Λ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and E is a matrix of errors. Multiplying both sides by S^-1 gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "S^-1 A S = Λ + S^-1 E S^-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since S is invertible, S^-1 E S^-1 is also diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues are zero (since it is a matrix of errors). Therefore, we have shown that A is similar to a diagonal matrix (Λ) plus a diagonalizable matrix of errors (S^-1 E S^-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that if A is diagonalizable, then it has n linearly independent eigenvectors (since the matrix of errors has eigenvalues of zero and is therefore diagonalizable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, then we can form the matrix V by taking these eigenvectors as columns, and we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "A V = V Λ\n",
    "\n",
    "where Λ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Therefore, A can be diagonalized by the Eigen-Decomposition approach."

    "The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that provides a powerful link between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix and its properties, such as symmetry and positive definiteness. In the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach, the spectral theorem is used to determine whether a matrix is diagonalizable and to express it in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",

This implies that any symmetric matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of its eigenvectors, with the corresponding eigenvalues as coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem also provides a way to classify symmetric matrices based on their eigenvalues. In particular, a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are positive; it is positive semi-definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are non-negative; and it is negative definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are negative.\n",

    "### Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",

    "To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, we need to solve the characteristic equation of the matrix, which is given by det(A - λI) = 0, where A is the matrix, λ is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix of the same size as A. The eigenvalues of A are the values of λ that satisfy the characteristic equation.\n",

    "The eigenvalues of a matrix represent the scaling factor by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk when multiplied by the matrix.

    "\n",
    "In other words, multiplying a matrix A by an eigenvector v results in a vector that is parallel to v, but scaled by the eigenvalue λ. Eigenvectors are important because they represent the directions in which a linear transformation represented by the matrix A acts only by scaling the vector, without changing its direction.\n",

Given an eigenvalue λ of a matrix A, we can find its corresponding eigenvectors by solving the system of linear equations (A - λI)v = 0, where I is the identity matrix of the same size as A. The nonzero solutions of this system correspond to the eigenvectors of A associated with the eigenvalue λ.\n",

    "\n",
    "The eigenvectors of a matrix represent the directions in which a linear transformation represented by the matrix acts only by scaling the vector, without changing its direction. For example, consider a 2D rotation matrix R that rotates any vector in the plane counterclockwise by an angle θ. The eigenvectors of R are the horizontal and vertical axes, which are not changed by the rotation but are simply scaled by a factor of 1. Therefore, the eigenvectors of R represent the two directions that are invariant under the rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of a matrix represent the scaling factor by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk when multiplied by the matrix. In other words, an eigenvalue λ of a matrix represents the factor by which the eigenvector v is scaled when multiplied by the matrix. For example, if A is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 and corresponding eigenvectors v1 and v2, then Av1 = λ1v1 and Av2 = λ2v2, which means that the matrix A scales the eigenvector v1 by a factor of λ1 and scales the eigenvector v2 by a factor of λ2.\n",
