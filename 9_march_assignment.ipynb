It is often used to describe the distribution of a random variable in a population, as well as to make predictions about future observations. Here are some reasons why the normal distribution is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The central limit theorem: One of the key reasons why the normal distribution is important is because of the central limit theorem. This theorem states that if you take a large enough sample from a population, the sample means will be normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the underlying population distribution. This property makes the normal distribution useful for modeling many real-world phenomena.\n",

    "2. Standardization: Another important property of the normal distribution is that it is standardized. This means that any normal distribution can be transformed into a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This makes it easier to compare different normal distributions and to make predictions based on standard scores.\n",
    "\n",

For example, stock prices are often modeled using the normal distribution, allowing investors to make predictions about future returns.\n",

    "The Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcome of a single binary experiment. In other words, it models the probability of success (usually denoted as \"1\") or failure (usually denoted as \"0\") in a single trial.\n",
    "Mathematically, the Bernoulli distribution can be described using a single parameter, p, which represents the probability of success in a single trial. The probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = p^x * (1 - p)^(1-x)\n",

    "    \n",
    "An example of the Bernoulli distribution might be the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads. If we define \"heads\" as a success and \"tails\" as a failure, then the probability of success (getting heads) would be p=0.5. Thus, the probability of getting heads (success) is P(X = 1) = 0.5, while the probability of getting tails (failure) is P(X = 0) = 0.5.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution describes the outcome of a single trial, while the binomial distribution describes the outcome of a series of independent trials. The binomial distribution is derived from the Bernoulli distribution by repeating the Bernoulli trial n times, with the probability of success (p) remaining the same for each trial.\n",
